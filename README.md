# bookShelfPlus

bookShelfPlus is an Online Library Management System (LMS) developed using Flask, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript. This project provides a digital solution for efficiently managing library operations, including book management, user management, and request processing.

Technologies Used
Flask: Python-based web framework used for backend development.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive design and layout.
JavaScript: Used for client-side interactivity, AJAX requests, and DOM manipulation.
SQLite: Database used for storing user data, book details, and request information.

Features
User Authentication: Users can register and login to the system. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities.
Book Management: Librarians can add, edit, delete, and view details of books in the library. Each book includes information such as title, author, genre, pages, availability, and more.
Request Processing: Users can request to borrow books from the library. Librarians can view pending requests, accept or deny requests, and manage book borrowing status.
User Status and Book Details: Librarians can view the status of users (e.g., books currently borrowed) and access detailed information about each book.
